# Data Wrangling

Proficiency working with dataframes--be it wrangling in python, R, or another langauge--is one of the most valuable skills you can have in a lab! There are also a wealth of online resources to help you develop your data wrangling skills at your own pace, or whenever you are looking for a way to fill remaining weekly hours in the lab. 

## R Coursera Courses

There are some excellent introductory statistics courses in R available on Coursera. The following courses are provided by Johns Hopkins and an excellent starting place for someone who is relatively new to programming and R: 

- [Getting Started with Data Visualization in R](https://www.coursera.org/learn/jhu-getting-started-data-viz-r) is a great course for someone with some basic skills using R for statistical analysis and will walk you through how to make data visualizations in R. This is good for someone who may not use R as a primary coding language as well--even though other langauges may be better suited to certain analyses, R creates some of the most visually appealing figures. This course is relatively short and contains only ~11 hours of coursework. 
- [Data Science: Foundations Using R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) is a self-paced beginner-leve introduction to R that will teach you the basics of using R to clean, analyze, and visualize data, as well as overview best research practices and how to use GitHub (the site used to create this wiki!). It is a longer course, projected to take ~4 months to complete at 10 hours per week. This is an excellent place to start if you have no R experience whatsoever. 
- [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) is a more in-depth introduction to using R to clean, analyze, and visualize data within the context of a publication-focused research project. It will also cover some statistical methods that will help you better understand how to implement R to ask the right questions in your data, as well as cover topics related to machine learning and managing your project using GitHub. It is the longest introductory course, estimated at ~7 months to complete at 10 hours per week. 

More advanced courses: 

- [Advanced Statistics for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-statistics-data-science) is a more advanced, R-based course that is great for improving your statistical knowledge and becoming more comfortable doing more advanced analyses in datasets. It is a shorter course projected to take ~1 month to complete at 10 hours per week. 

### R Cheat Sheets

Here are a couple of cheat sheets that are useful for data wrangling in R:
