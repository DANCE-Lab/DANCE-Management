## Course Expectations
1. RAs receiving course credit for their lab contributions are expected to attend and contribute to weekly lab meetings, track their hours, and complete required canvas assignments (check-ins, discussion questions, final paper, and final presentation)
- We will meet in-person in Campbell Hall, room 200, weekly on Wednesdays from 3:30-4:30pm
2. RAs assigned to lab workgroups are expected to attend weekly workgroup meetings and contribute to workgroup projects
3. RAs are expected to conduct themselves professionally and to establish open communication with supervisors in the lab
4. RAs are expected to complete assigned tasks on time, be prepared for meetings, and to respond to emails, slack messages, and other lab communications 

## Course Assignments
1. Journal Club Discussion Questions 
- Every week, you will be expected to read the chosen journal club paper and submit a discussion question on canvas by 11:59pm the night before the next lab meeting
- Each RA will create a brief presentation for a journal club one time per semester. Over the course of 5-10 minutes, you will summarize the journal club article and co-lead the following discussion with the lab manager. This presentation (acceptable in the form of powerpoint slides, bullet point notes, etc.) can be submitted in place of your discussion question on canvas the night before lab meeting. 
- These questions are graded on completion and count for 10% of your total course grade
2. Weekly Check-Ins
- You will submit a brief reflection on canvas by 11:59pm each Friday. These reflections are an opportunity to consider where you did well in your labwork that week, pose questions, and raise concerns
- These check-ins are graded on completion and will count for 5% of your total course grade
3. Final Term Paper
- You will write a 2-5 page research proposal on a chosen topic under the DANCE Lab researach umbrella (development, affective neuroscience, culture, and environment)
- This paper is due on Canvas by 11:59pm on Tuesday, December 10th
- The paper must include the following sections: 
> - Project Summary (Abstract): 100-150 word summary of your proposal
> - Objective: What is your research question? What do you aim to accomplish in this project?
> - Significance: Why is it important to execute this project? What gap in the knowledge does your project address?
> - Methodology: What methods will you use to carry out your project?
> - Works Cited
4. Final Presentation
- You will create a 5 minute slide presentation summarizing the project outlined in your written research proposal. RAs will present their projects during the final lab meeting of the semester, on Wednesday, December 11th
- This presentation is due on canvas by Tuesday, December 10th, at 11:59pm

## Accessing Python Notebooks and Viewing RA Scripts

We will be using Jupyter notebooks to begin learning about data cleaning and analysis! These notebooks can be found on the lab github, in the repository [RA Scripts](https://github.com/DANCE-Lab/RA_scripts/tree/main/Learning_Python_Notebooks) and can be opened using one of several platforms: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator) (either by downloading the application or through the online platform), [Viisual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Google Colab](https://colab.google/). VS Code and the downloaded version of Anaconda Navigator will be the best platforms for more serious or in-depth projects, but online platforms are perfect for easily accessing somewhere to practice and run through the assigned Jupyter Notebooks! 

#### Instructions for Opening Notebooks through Google Colab

If it is your first time using a Jupyter Notebook, I highly recommend starting with Google Colab as this is the easiest, most user-friendly online option. Please note: code may run more slowly on Google Colab than on your computer. 

Steps to open a practice Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab: 
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) in your browser
2. Click on the button called "Open Colab"
3. Click on the button "GitHub" in the "Open Notebook" window
4. Open the [RA Scripts](https://github.com/DANCE-Lab/RA_scripts/tree/main/Learning_Python_Notebooks) GitHub page in your browser
5. Choose the notebook that you want to open in Colab. Copy the URL (Example: [URL for Notbook 1: Learning Python Variables: Strings and Conditionals](https://github.com/DANCE-Lab/RA_scripts/blob/main/Learning_Python_Notebooks/1_Learning_Python_Variables_Strings_and_Conditionals.ipynb))
6. Paste the URL in the Colab bar that says "Enter a GitHub URL"

This should open your notebook! Colab will automatically connect you to Python 3 and you will be able to run notebook code blocks in your browser by clicking the little triangle in the upper left hand corner of the code block (looks like a "play" button). Please reach out to your lab manager if you have any further difficulties running the notebook!
