## Course Expectations
1. RAs receiving course credit for their lab contributions are expected to attend and contribute to weekly lab meetings, track their hours, and complete required canvas assignments (check-ins, discussion questions, final paper, and final presentation)
- We will meet in-person in Campbell Hall, room 200, weekly on Wednesdays from 3:30-4:30pm
2. RAs assigned to lab workgroups are expected to attend weekly workgroup meetings and contribute to workgroup projects
3. RAs are expected to conduct themselves professionally and to establish open communication with supervisors in the lab
4. RAs are expected to complete assigned tasks on time, be prepared for meetings, and to respond to emails, slack messages, and other lab communications 

## Course Assignments
1. Journal Club Discussion Questions 
- Every week, you will be expected to read the chosen journal club paper and submit a discussion question on canvas by 11:59pm the night before the next lab meeting
- Each RA will create a brief presentation for a journal club one time per semester. Over the course of 5-10 minutes, you will summarize the journal club article and co-lead the following discussion with the lab manager. This presentation (acceptable in the form of powerpoint slides, bullet point notes, etc.) can be submitted in place of your discussion question on canvas the night before lab meeting. 
- These questions are graded on completion and count for 10% of your total course grade
2. Weekly Check-Ins
- You will submit a brief reflection on canvas by 11:59pm each Friday. These reflections are an opportunity to consider where you did well in your labwork that week, pose questions, and raise concerns
- These check-ins are graded on completion and will count for 5% of your total course grade
3. Final Term Paper
- You will write a 2-5 page research proposal on a chosen topic under the DANCE Lab researach umbrella (development, affective neuroscience, culture, and environment)
- This paper is due on Canvas by 11:59pm on Tuesday, December 10th
- The paper must include the following sections: 
> - Project Summary (Abstract): 100-150 word summary of your proposal
> - Objective: What is your research question? What do you aim to accomplish in this project?
> - Significance: Why is it important to execute this project? What gap in the knowledge does your project address?
> - Methodology: What methods will you use to carry out your project?
> - Works Cited
4. Final Presentation

- Journal Club Discussion Question 2 due by 11:59 pm on October 1st

> This review of emotion regulation (context, process, and neural correlates) is a good introduction to the topic. The field of emotion regulation is still very much developing and changing, but this review provides an empirical foundation that will help us better hold contradicting and complex perspectives on emotion regulation in the future.

### October 9th
SREEN TIME GROUP LITERATURE REVIEW

Topic Categories: 
- Brain and Cognition: Carsyn
- Emotion and Self-Regulation: Kathryn, Cecilia, and Anna
- Social and Family: Maya and Kennedy
*Articles*: Please select two articles pertaining to your subject area
*Annotated bibliography*: Please write up a brief annotation (~100 words) for each item in your bibliography. In this annotation, please explain the aim of the paper, the methods (pertaining to the screen time measure we are interested in) and the key findings (also screen-time related)
*Extract Measures*: Please have a copy of the screen time measure used in both of your papers to show the lab next week! Sometimes this takes a little sleuthing--look in the paper's bibliography, SciHub, or try googling the name of the measure to obtain the scale.
*Summary*: What did you learn about how screen time impacts kids' development in your assigned research area? Please summarize your takeaways in ~300 words.

Please submit your summary and annotated bibliography in place of your journal discussion next week!
