# Guide for CPSY4994 Final Paper: How to Write a Research Proposal

## Structure

You will write a short research proposal at the end of the semester. The proposal should be between 2 and five pages (double-spaced, 12 point font), and should clearly and concisely lay out your research motivation, aims, and intended protocol. This proposal can be on any research topic of interest, as long as it falls under the DANCE Lab umbrella (i.e., pertaining to research in development, affective neuroscience, culture, and/or emotion). You will also create a conference-style poster outlining each section of your proposal and including one methods figure to help your audience better understand your intended research protocol. 

Your proposal should include the following sections: 

### Abstract
Provide a ~100 word summary of your proposal. Make sure to highlight your research question, research aims, and briefly outline your methodology. This should act as a road map or a preview of your proposal contents for anyone reading your paper.

### Introduction/Objective
The introduction is an opportunity for you to introduce your objective. Explain your research question, your hypotheses, and your research aims. This section requires a very strong thesis sentence(s) that should capture the motivation of your paper. 

>Thesis sentence: Every thesis should outline and briefly justify and explain the significance of your research problem before outlining your research aims. 
>For example: *While traditional cakes, when consumed, have been shown to significantly improve participant mood and provide an effective solution to a Bad Day, few effective gluten-free options exist for individuals who cannot consume flour-based confections. This study aims to develop an equally delicious gluten-free cake recipe through the systematic evaluation of several flour-alternatives, which shall rated by both gluten-tolerant and gluten-intolerant populations using the Cake Tastiness Scale.*
>This thesis clearly outlines subject (cake tastiness), the research problem (few effective gluten-free alternatives exist), and the significance of this research problem (that cakes are an effective solution to a Bad Day). It goes on to clearly state the study aims (to develop an equally effective gluten free recipe) and briefly outlines proposed methods (to evalute success using the Cake Tastiness Scale in both gluten-tolerant and gluten-intolerant populations). These sentences clearly let your reader know what you hope to accomplish in your study and let them know what to expect in each section of your proposal. 

At the end of the section, clearly state your hypotheses. You may even write them out at the bottom of your introduction: 

- **H0: Implementation of flour alternatives in the cake recipe will fail to improve the scores of gluten-free cakes on the Cake Tastiness Scale**
- **H1: Implementation of flour alternatives in the cake recipe will improve the scores of gluten-free cakes on the Cake Tastiness Scale**

>Note: In this proposed study, the independent variable is flour/flour alternatives, and the dependent variable is cake tastiness. This study will evaluate the impact modulation of the independent variable (flour type) has on the dependent variable (cake tastiness).
