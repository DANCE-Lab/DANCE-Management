# Research Teams
All of the teams are under the direction of Dr. Ka Ip.

## Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
### People
- Tianying Cai
- Madeleine Seitz
- Katie L. Friese
- Carsyn Hartung
- Cecilia Giron
- Anna Jiang
- Pollyanna Vergara
- Samantha Miller
- Brooklyn Krull
### Where
- Minnesota State Fair
- Minnesota Children's Museum
- DANCE testing room 
### Overview
A light-based, non-invasive brain scanning device designed to read blood oxygen consumption levels in the brain. 
Currently it is being primarily used for children in the DANCE lab.
At the Minnesota State Fair, the "Neighborhood opportunity survey" in Redcap is given to the parent's while the children are fitted for the caps and participate. 

## Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
### People
- Anna Jiang
### Where
TBD
### Overview
An adult survey designed to capture emotional regulation data while the participant is in their natural environment. A compilation of (BLANK) surveys. 

## Hyper Scanning
### People
TBD
### Where
DANCE testing room
### Overview
A subset of the fNIRS team. Running two sets of fNIRS devices at the same time to measure how much brain waves sync up between participants. 
After simulating an emotional event by playing a stressful video game (Overcooked 2), the participants talk out how the game went for them and then about stressful events in their life. 

## Emotional Regulation Repertoire (ERR) for Kids aged 6-8
### People
- Philip Lamb
- Mia Chen
- Madeleine Seitz
- Katie L. Friese
- Boyu Wen
### Where
TBD
### Overview
A 2-pronged study to assess how children articulate emotional regulation strategies.
Study one uses vignettes about an astronaut in different contexts encountering moderately stressful situations. The child must then give guidance to the astronaut on how to regulate their emotions.
Study two utilizes a board game to get children to tell stories of how they dealt with stressful situations in different contexts: School, Home, and Alone.
