# Writing an IRB Protocol 

Beginning an IRB protocol can feel daunting, but luckily the UMN IRB has a wealth of resources and templates to make the process simpler. Some key links are listed below: 
- A collection of UMN [IRB Templates](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/toolkit-library/templates-forms) to help you get started on whichever document you need to prepare
- The IRB [Investigator Manual](https://research.umn.edu/sites/research.umn.edu/files/hrp-103_-_investigator_manual_google_doc.pdf), whcih will answer specific questions regarding research practices, review, consenting, advertising, PHI, etc. 
- The [UMN IRB overview](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/about-us/overview) to provide a better overview of the University of Minnesota's specific IRB structure and practices (boards vary between institutions and by state--it is important to be informed about the IRB at your current institution)
- FAQs and important links on [starting a new study](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/how-submit/new-study). 
- A guide for developing [REDCap Electronic Consent Forms](https://ctsi.umn.edu/news/how-use-redcap-electronic-consent). These guidelines must be followed EXACTLY in order to receive IRB approval and to conduct your study.
