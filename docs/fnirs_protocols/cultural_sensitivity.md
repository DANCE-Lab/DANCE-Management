# Cultural Sensitivity Quick Guide for RAs

## General Guide: 
1. Always be responsive and courteous to participants' needs. 
2. Be sure to ask for consent before the experiment and permission while performing tasks.
3. Ensure that participants are fully informed of what the study will entail and if they are comfortable with its elements as well. 
4. Let the participants know that they can share any concerns or questions they have at any point in the study.

## Specifics for Hijab Wearing Participants:
1. Beforehand, always be sure to inform participants that fNIRS will require the removal of any head garment so the mesh cap containing the optodes can be properly placed onto the head. Inform them that a private space will be allocated for them to do so if they wish to continue being a part of the experiment. If the subjects are comfortable with the idea then you can proceed.
- Be sure to ask both the parent and the child participant for permission on top of other consenting. 

2. Ensure that a private place is established to complete cap sizing and fitting for participants who need it.
- If the experiment takes place in the ICD building then the family room can be utilized to perform this rather than the waiting room. 
- If the experiment takes place outside of our lab then locate a private room to use. If that is not possible, you may be able to find a corner and use a changing curtain stand

3. For hijab wearing participants, it is essential to allow female members of the research assistant team to aid them in proper cap sizing and fitting. 
4. While performing the cap measurements, the RA performing this task should ask if the participant can remove their head scarf so they can take a few measurements of their head. If the participants' hair is placed in a bun, or something similar, ask if they can remove that as well.
5. After placing the cap over the head, provide the subject with another garment to cover themselves, ideally a black slip on hijab to place over the mesh cap.
